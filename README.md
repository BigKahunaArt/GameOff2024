# GameOff2024
Submission for the #GameOff2024

About:

This is my submission for GameOff2024 you'll find the project's code to be in varying levels of quality. There was more things I wanted to do with this project but I simply ran out of time and/or had higher priorities for completing this during the timeframe.

All assets have been removed from the project due to various licensing restrictions.

License:

No permission is given (or is able to be given) for use of any assets remaining within the project's code. Assets include but are not limited to: art, music, textures, models etc.

The "Andi" logo remains property of BigKahunaArt and no permission is given for reproduction, modification or use of logo without explicit permission.

All blueprint and shader code is released under MIT.
